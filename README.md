# *ML full cycle*
## Classification task

Repository aggregates full-cycle machine learning scripts of binary classificator model training, testing and deployment
 in case with unbalanced dirty real data.

Check-points:
1. Exploratory data analysis
    (With pretty Plotly visualisations)
2. Cleaning data
3. Imputation NAs
4. Exploratory modelling and specification choice
5. MinMax normalizing  and RFECV
6. GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
7. Different models training with quality metrics representation on StratifiedCV
8. Best estimator predicting on test data
9. Feature Importance, ROC_AUC curve, quality metrics, confusion matrix
10. Serializing and deserializing model objects for easy deploy
